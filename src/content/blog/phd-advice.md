# Advice for [Your Audience]

Advice posts are popular because everyone loves learning from others' experience. Replace this with your own insights—whether for PhD students, new faculty, industry researchers, or anyone else.

## The Big Picture

Start with your overarching philosophy. What's the most important thing you've learned?

> "Insert your favorite quote here—whether from a mentor, a book, or your own experience."

## Specific Lessons

Break down your advice into actionable points:

1. **Lesson One**: Explanation and context
2. **Lesson Two**: Why this matters and how to apply it
3. **Lesson Three**: A concrete example from your experience

## What I Wish I'd Known

Be honest about mistakes you made. These are often the most valuable parts of advice posts:

```python
def learn_from_mistakes():
    while still_learning:
        try_things()
        make_mistakes()  # This is normal!
        reflect_and_adjust()
        keep_going()
```

## The Reality Check

Balance optimism with realism. What's genuinely hard? What do people underestimate?

As [Randall Munroe](https://xkcd.com/1205/) might say, sometimes the math on optimization doesn't work out how you expect.
