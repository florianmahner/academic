# Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my blog! This is where I share thoughts on research, [your field], and academic life. Think of it as a place for ideas that don't quite fit into papers but are too interesting to keep in my notes.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Research insights**: Behind-the-scenes looks at ongoing work
- **Tutorials**: Guides on tools and techniques I find useful
- **Reflections**: Thoughts on academia, productivity, and learning
- **Miscellany**: The occasional [xkcd reference](https://xkcd.com/927/) or interesting tangent

## Why Blog?

Writing helps me think more clearly. It also lets me share ideas that might be useful to others—without the overhead of formal publication. As [Paul Graham writes](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html), "writing is thinking."

## A Note on This Template

If you're using this template for your own site, feel free to keep, modify, or delete this post. The blog supports:

```python
# Code blocks with syntax highlighting
def welcome():
    return "Hello, reader!"
```

Math equations via LaTeX: $E = mc^2$

And Markdown formatting like **bold**, *italic*, and [links](https://example.com).
