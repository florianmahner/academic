# SUBJ 799: Research Seminar

**Spring 2024** | Your University

## Seminar Description

Weekly research seminar for PhD students. We discuss recent papers, practice presentations, and develop research ideas together. This is a supportive environment for growing as researchers.

## What We Do

- Read and discuss 1-2 papers per week
- Practice conference presentations
- Give feedback on work-in-progress
- Invite guest speakers
- Develop collaboration opportunities

## Format

Each week, one student leads discussion:

- 20 min: Paper presentation
- 30 min: Group discussion
- 10 min: Connections to ongoing research

## Why Run a Seminar?

Seminars are valuable for both students and faculty:

- **For Students**: Exposure to current research, presentation practice, community building
- **For Faculty**: Identify talented students, stay current, foster collaboration

## How to Customize

1. **Focus Area**: What papers do you typically read?
2. **Frequency**: Weekly, biweekly, or monthly?
3. **Guest Speakers**: List notable visitors
4. **Output**: Do participants co-author papers?
