# DeepLearn: Modern Machine Learning Framework

A production-ready PyTorch-based framework for rapid prototyping and deployment of deep learning models with built-in experiment tracking and distributed training support.

## Features

- Rapid prototyping with minimal boilerplate code
- Distributed training across multiple GPUs and nodes
- Built-in experiment tracking (MLflow, W&B, TensorBoard)
- Pre-built model zoo with popular architectures
- Export to ONNX, TorchScript, and TensorFlow Lite

## Installation

```bash
pip install deeplearn
```

## Usage

See the [documentation](#) for detailed usage examples and API reference.
