  bio: |
    I am a researcher exploring the fascinating intersection of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience' target='_blank'>computational neuroscience</a> and <a href='https://distill.pub' target='_blank'>interpretable machine learning</a>. My work investigates how artificial systems can learn, reason, and adapt in ways that mirror—and sometimes surpass—biological intelligence.

  # Research interests and focus areas
  #
  # Use this to explain:
  #   - What problems you find interesting
  #   - How your work bridges disciplines
  #   - Your broader intellectual curiosity
  #   - What drives your research
  #
  # Format: Same as bio (HTML supported, use | for multi-line)
  #
  research_interests: |
    My research interests span representation learning, computational cognitive modeling, and the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence. I believe the most interesting questions emerge at disciplinary boundaries—where computer science meets neuroscience, where statistics meets epistemology. I'm also fascinated by open science and finding elegant solutions to complex problems.
